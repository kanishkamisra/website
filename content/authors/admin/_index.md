I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University, where I work on Natural Language Understanding with [Dr. Julia Taylor Rayz](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/taylo108) at the [AKRaNLU Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AKRANLU/). I also work closely with [Dr. Allyson Ettinger](https://aetting.github.io/) and her lab at UChicago. **I am currently on the job market for post-doctoral position! Please reach out if you think I am a good fit for your lab!**

My research focuses on evaluating and analyzing large language models from the perspective of human semantic cognition, investigating capacities such as their ability to encode [typicality effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02987), [recall property knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06910), demonstrate [property inheritance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01963), and perform human-like [category-based induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06910). Through my work, I hope to contribute towards bridging the experimental paradigms in the study of human cognition with that of artificial intelligence systems.

<!--I am particularly interested in characterizing the semantic knowledge made available to computational models that only learn from textual exposure. I work closely with [Dr. Allyson Ettinger](https://aetting.github.io/) and her lab at UChicago. 
<!--I am also affiliated with [CERIAS](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/), Purdue's center for research and education in areas of information security.-->

I spent Fall 2022 as a Research Intern at Google AI working on multi-hop reasoning and language models!

I was recently selected to be a Graduate Student Fellow in the inaugural [Purdue Graduate School Mentoring Fellows](https://news.cla.purdue.edu/2021/12/01/purdues-graduate-school-mentoring-graduate-student-fellow-program/) program!

I am the author of [minicons](https://minicons.kanishka.website), a python package that facilitates large scale behavioral analyses of transformer language models.

I recently hosted a two part discussion group on [Neural Nets for Cognition](https://neural-nets-for-cognition.net/) @ [CogSci 2022](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2022/)!

<!--In 2018, I was fortunate to be awarded the Purdue Research Foundation fellowship (now known as the Ross-Lynn Graduate Student Fellowship). I then taught database fundamentals to sophomore level undergraduates for three semesters. I am currently funded by an [NSF-EAGER grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2039605&HistoricalAwards=false) focused on using artificial intelligence techniques to develop entertainment education materials for social-engineering research.-->

<!--I enjoy mentoring students interested in Natural Language Processing, check out my CV for some examples of undergraduate projects I have mentored.--->
