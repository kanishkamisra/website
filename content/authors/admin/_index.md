I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University, where I work on Natural Language Understanding with [Dr. Julia Taylor Rayz](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/taylo108) at the [AKRaNLU Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AKRANLU/). I am particularly interested in relating natural language processing algorithms and models from the perspective of ideas in cognitive science (specifically, the study of concepts and categories). I work closely with [Dr. Allyson Ettinger](https://aetting.github.io/) of UChicago. I am also affiliated with [CERIAS](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/), Purdue's center for research and education in areas of information security.

In 2018, I was fortunate to be a Purdue Research Foundation fellow. I then taught database fundamentals to sophomore level undergraduates for three semesters. I am currently funded by an [NSF-EAGER grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2039605&HistoricalAwards=false) focused on integrating cybersecurity education through Computational Humor.

<!--I enjoy mentoring students interested in Natural Language Processing, check out my CV for some examples of undergraduate projects I have mentored.--->
