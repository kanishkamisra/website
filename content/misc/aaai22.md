I will be presenting my thesis "pre-proposal" at the AAAI 2022 Doctoral Consortium. This proposal deals with exploring how computational models that acquire their semantic knowledge from text (through pre-training) generalize to novel information. The application required three key materials:

- [Research Summary](../../papers/aaai2022dc.pdf)
- [Personal Statement](../../papers/aaai2022statement.pdf)
- My CV (I submitted a two page version of my [CV](/files/kanishkamisracv.pdf))
