## Fun

I have been enjoying reading whodunnits these days (early 2023), and one of my favorite whodunnit writers is [Anthony Horowitz](https://anthonyhorowitz.com/). Here are some of his books I really liked:

- Susan Ryeland series:
  - Magpie Murders.
  - Moonflower Murders.
- Hawthorne and Horowitz series:
  - The word is murder
  - The sentence is death
  - A line to kill
  - The twist of a knife
  
Other whodunnits/books with whodunnit vibes I've recently read:

- **The Appeal** by Janice Hallett
- **The Twyford Code** by Janice Hallett
- **The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels** by Janice Hallett
- **The Marlow Murder Club** by Robert Thorogood
- **Death comes to Marlow** by Robert Thorogood
- **The Thursday Murder Club** by Richard Osman (currently reading).

One day I hope to solve [Cain's Jawbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone) by Edward Powys Mathers.

I recently visited a cat cafe and met this amazing cat named cheesy poof! He is amazing and I hope a prosperous life is in store for him:
