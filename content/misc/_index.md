## Fun

I have been enjoying reading whodunnits these days (early 2023), and my favorite whodunnit writers is [Anthony Horowitz](https://anthonyhorowitz.com/). Here are some of his books I really liked:

- Susan Ryeland series:
  - Magpie Murders.
  - Moonflower Murders.
- Hawthorne and Horowitz series:
  - The word is murder
  - The sentence is death
  - A line to kill
  - The twist of a knife -- *currently listening*
  
I recently visited a cat cafe and met this amazing cat (see below), I hope a prosperous life is in store for him:
