## Fun

In my spare time, I like to play tennis, do jigsaw puzzles, and bake bagels and different kinds of bread!

I have been enjoying reading whodunnits these days (early 2023), and one of my favorite whodunnit writers is [Anthony Horowitz](https://anthonyhorowitz.com/). Here are some of his books I really liked:

- Susan Ryeland series:
  - **Magpie Murders**
  - **Moonflower Murders**
  - **Marblehall Murders**
- Hawthorne and Horowitz series:
  - **The word is murder**
  - **The sentence is death**
  - **A line to kill**
  - **The twist of a knife**
  - **Close to death**
  - *he has 7 more planned!!*
  
Other whodunnits/books with whodunnit vibes I've recently read:

- **The Appeal** by Janice Hallett
- **The Twyford Code** by Janice Hallett
- **The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels** by Janice Hallett
- **The Examiner** by Janice Hallett
- **The Killer Question** by Janice Hallett (will read on Sept 23!)
- **The Marlow Murder Club** by Robert Thorogood (didn't really like this)
- **Death comes to Marlow** by Robert Thorogood (didn't really like this either)
- **The Thursday Murder Club** by Richard Osman (currently reading, slowly...).

I recently started reading Robert Galbraith's Cormoran Strike series (rank so far in parantheses, titles ordered by chronology):

- **Cuckoo's Calling** (6 -- this was very predictable)
- **The Silkworm** (5 -- kind of boring, and I'm generally not a fan of gore)
- **A Career of Evil** (4 -- very good! I loved the character development here)
- **Lethal White** (2 -- v v good! character development continues to improve)
- **Troubled Blood** (1 -- best one so far, not only is the character development at its peak but the actual mystery is by far the most intriguing)
- **The Ink Black Heart** (1.5 -- similar to troubled blood, the climax was rushed, which is why this is still below troubled blood.)
- **The Running Grave** (3 -- very good character development, but main story was not as good as TB or IBH)
- **The Hallmarked Man** (have pre-ordered!)

One day I hope to solve [Cain's Jawbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone) by Edward Powys Mathers.

I once visited a cat cafe and met this amazing cat named cheesy poof! He is amazing and I hope a prosperous life is in store for him:
