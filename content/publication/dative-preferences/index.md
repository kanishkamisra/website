abstract: >
  Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, 
  but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general 
  properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation 
  (DO\: "gave Y the X" vs. PO\: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively 
  train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties that affect the choice of alternant\: 
  length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies 
  for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating 
  datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first 
  preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to 
  manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find 
  that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come 
  from a mix of direct and indirect sources.
